###Project 0: Search  

  

This was my first adventure back into web development!

A front-end clone for Google Search, Google Image Search, Google Advanced Search, and Google Image Advanced Search.  

HTML, CSS, Javascript  

Note: While I'm calling this "finished", there are a few things I'm not happy with still. Maybe one day I'll come back. Also -- Not optimized for mobile </3
